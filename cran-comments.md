# new maintainer

This package started giving an error with R devel

I was alerted because I have a dependency that risked being archived (rddtools)

I've fixed the C (now) "error"

I've fixec the additional issues

There is a note on me being a new maintainer

There is a note on escaped LaTeX characters, this is correct
